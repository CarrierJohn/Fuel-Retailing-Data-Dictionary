# Fuel-Retailing-Data-Dictionary
This is the API Data Dictionary for IFSF and Conexxus Standards Bodies.

The data dictionary contains both elements and objects ( a collections of 2 or more data elements)

The dictionary is open to the public and everybody is allowed to use its content - for example to udnerstand fuel retailing and to define further innovative and colaborative APIS.

The APIs - which use these objects and elements - are held on the standard bodies web sites (www.ifsf.org and www.conexxus.org)) where membership is necessary to gain access.

Members of the public are requested to inform us of missing data elements and objects, as they deem fit. Similarly corrections, additions, improvements and clarifications of the existing elements and objects are welcome. These changes will be reviewd by work groups within Conexxus and IFSF, and accepted (comit'ed using GIT repository terminology) into the dictionary.

If you want to offer APIs - you should first check they, of business functional similar ones do not already exist - then you need to join one of the standards bodies. Although you will not get access to the detailed APIs, but reference to individual data elements and data objects you can glean a prety good idea exactly what the API does by its name and description.

You can find out more by contacting admin@ifsf.com or info@conexxus.org
