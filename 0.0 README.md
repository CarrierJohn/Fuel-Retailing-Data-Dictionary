# Fuel-Retailing-Data-Dictionary

This is the API Data Dictionary (“Dictionary”), jointly owned by the IFSF (www.ifsf.org) and Conexxus (www.conexxus.org), and shared in order to assist in the use of our international standards.

The Dictionary contains individual elements and objects, defined as collections of 2 or more data elements/properties. Individual elements and objects within the dictionary are open to the public and everybody is allowed to use them.  For example, we expect many users will find the Dictionary helpful to understand fuel retailing and to define further innovative and collaborative APIs.

The Dictionary is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”), which can be read in full in the Section 0.1 License.  For the purpose of clarity, under this Public License, IFSF and Conexxus jointly shall hold the copyright on the Directory and act as Co-Licensors.  The License granted by the IFSF and Conexxus applies to the Dictionary, including the owners’ Sui Generis Database Rights (“Database Rights” i.e., rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world).  Under the License, users are free to use the Dictionary to create Adapted Material, where all such material is subject to the copyright and Database Rights that are derived from or based upon the Dictionary.  Co-Licensors hereby grant a user a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Dictionary to: (a) reproduce and share the Dictionary, in whole or in part, without removing any copyright notice; and (b) produce, reproduce, and share its Adapted Material.  Please be aware, however, that if you intend to translate, alter, arrange, transform, or otherwise modify the Dictionary, you must obtain written permission in advance from the Co-Licensors.

The APIs, which use these elements and objects, are owned and hosted on the standard bodies’ web sites (www.ifsf.org  and www.conexxus.org) where membership is necessary to gain access.

Members of the public are requested to inform us of missing data elements and objects at the following:  ltoth@conexxus.org and projects@ifsf.org.  Similarly, corrections, additions, improvements, and clarifications of the existing elements and objects are welcome. All proposed changes will be reviewed by work groups within Conexxus and IFSF, and accepted (or comit'ed using GIT repository terminology) into the dictionary. Changes and additions are reviewed to assure consistency throughout the dictionary and to avoid duplications of the same name being used for the identical element or object.
