# Fuel-Retailing-Data-Dictionary
This is the API Data Dictionary for IFSF (www.ifsf.org) and Conexxus (www.conexxus.org) Standards Bodies.

The dictionary contains individual elements and objects ( a collections of 2 or more data elements/properties)

Individual elemtns and objects within the dictionary is open to the public and everybody is allowed to use them - for example to understand fuel retailing and to define further innovative and collaborative APIS. The dictionary is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License which can be read in full in the section 0.1 License.

The APIs - which use these elements and objects - are held on the standard bodies web sites (www.ifsf.org and www.conexxus.org)) where membership is necessary to gain access. 

Members of the public are requested to inform us of missing data elements and objects, as they deem fit. Similarly corrections, additions, improvements and clarifications of the existing elements and objects are welcome. These changes will be reviewd by work groups within Conexxus and IFSF, and accepted (comit'ed using GIT repository terminology) into the dictionary. Changes and additions are reviewed to reduce to the minimum the same name being used for the identical element or object.

If you want to offer new or extended APIs - you must first check whether the specific business functional you which to describe does not already exist - so you will need to join one of the standards bodies. Although this dictionary does not provide access to the detailed APIs, by definition and description of individual data elements and  objects you are able to glean a pretty reliable and accurate idea about exactly what the API does by its name and description.

You can find out more about the future plans for extending this data dictionary by contacting admin@ifsf.com or info@conexxus.org
